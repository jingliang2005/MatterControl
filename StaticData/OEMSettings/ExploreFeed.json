This new solution is all software, you will not need to change any hardware or firmware. It will work today.</p>\n<p>Hey everyone, here is the promised update to our <a href=\"../../news/working-to-add-automatic-printer-calibration\">first post</a> about our work on automatic bed height calibration and leveling.&nbsp; In that post we showed a working implementation of custom firmware gathering data on the level of the print bed and then automatically compensating its movements. Since then we've been working to put the final pieces in place in order to have a full solution that can be used in day-to-day 3D printing. Now, with two printable parts (a z-probe and a modified x-carriage), some magnets, and a switch, it is possible to add automatic bed height calibration and leveling to a Mendel90.</p></div>",

Her most recent endeavor was producing masks and props for the schools production of the play, <em>The Lion King</em>.
